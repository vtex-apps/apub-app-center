Admin component that groups all the apps made in the region for quick and easy access to documentation, requirements, tutorials and demos.

### How to develop admins

1. Admins always declare routes in `/admin/app/<route>`

2. Declare the `admin` builder in your manifest

3. When installed, the user navigates to `/admin/<route>`, but your app runs in an iframe that points to `/admin/app/<route>`.

4. You can develop directly in the `/admin/app` route for convenience, but don't forget to test it inside the iframe. :)

### Quickstart

1. Clone this repo

2. `yarn --cwd react/` for code completion

3. `vtex link`

4. Navigate to `workspace--account.myvtex.com/admin/app/example`
